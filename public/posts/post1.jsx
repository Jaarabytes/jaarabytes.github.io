        <br></br>
        <p>Got into web2 security.(It's 17th October 2023)</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Found some Out of scope vulnerabilities(It's 14th January 2024)</p>
        <p>They include:</p>
        <p>HTML injection and Cross Site Scripting on a webchat bot. This however is not vulnerability since no victim is involved.</p>
        <p>An 'error based SQL injection' which turned out to be poor error handling on the PHP backend(This was revealed due to laravel syntax).</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Started learning web3 and smart contracts with hope to earn as an auditor and bug hunter for both web2 and web3 (22nd February 2024)</p>
