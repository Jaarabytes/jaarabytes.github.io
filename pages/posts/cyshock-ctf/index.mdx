# Cyshock CTF

On the quest for knowledge, I participated in Cyshock CTF which was on during 14th to 16th May.

I did not get to solve that many challenges since they were quite challenging.

Let's dig in. 

## Web

### An alarming site

Provided is a [link](cyshock-ch2.chals.io) through which one is to interact with the website. On typing help i got the list of commands but the command `ping` looked at me curiously since it was the only one which accepted user input.

I tried to ping `google.com` and it worked. I proceeded to perform a custom XSS payload and it somewhat worked.

The payload:

```
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

On trying it while using brave browser, it got this popup

After the CTF ended and writeups released, I was told that the payload is correct however I had to use firefox browser or change the user-agent. On trying this on Librewolf (privacy focused alternative to firefox), it absolutely works and got the flag

## Misc

### A new song

Attached is a [WAV file](https://cyshock.ctfd.io/files/c2c436ce4feb4fd444ba32b780633543/chall.wav?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5OTMsInRlYW1faWQiOjYyMSwiZmlsZV9pZCI6MjF9.aCcQSg.SI3nZwonx_53xY8rOr_-s90LAMg). On hearing the wav file, it seemed like morse code.

I proceeded to upload it to [morse code world](https://morsecode.world) from which as seen on the attached image below, I obtained the flag.
