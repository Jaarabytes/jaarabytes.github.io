# Git rid of it <br /> <br />
                
    Have you ever encountered this error before? (Perhaps when cloning a private github repository): 
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>Git authentication failed? fatal: No credential store has been selected. Support for password authentication was removed in 13th August 2021.</i>
    <br />
    <br />
    ![git error that prompts for authentication](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-02-26_13_54_28.jpg)<br />
    Well, I have, and I finally figured it out
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    Enough of foreplay, let's get serious. <br />
    
    
    It seems that github enhanced their security such that inputting your password and
    username is not enough for them, since an attacker can easily get them through social 
    engineering. There are two ways of authentication (those that I know of)
    
    <br />
    They include:
    - `Using Secure SHell (SSH) with its key`
    - `Using the Command Line Interface`
    <br />
    ## 1. The SSH method (my favorite)
    <br />
    When cloning the preferred github repository, you will have to use the SSH url
    ![ssh url clone github repository](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-02-26_14_57_25.jpg)<br />
    Before that, you have to create a ssh key, which is a private and public key which 
        authenticate you. These keys are tedious and time-consuming to crack.
    
    <br />
    They can be generated by the following command: 
    <br />
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C < your_email@example.com >  
    ```


    <br />
    <br />
    I will explain the commands:
    <br />
        * `ssh-keygen` - Generates the SSH key pair
        * `-t rsa` - Uses RSA algorithm
        * `b 4096` - Uses 4096 bytes for generation
        * `C <youremail@example.com>` - your email is used as comment
    <br />
    <br />
    
    This will be the response from the terminal: 
    
    <br />
    ```
    Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    
        You will be prompted to input and confirm a safe passphrase.
        ( You may
        also press Enter to skip this process. )
    
    <br />
    
        Add your ssh key to the ssh agent by running the below command
        (Depending on the system you are running, you may need superuser privileges)
    
    <br />
    ```
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    You  may want to verify if your SSH key was added. Use the below command: 
    <br />
    ```
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Onto the finals where we add the ssh key to our github account:
    ![github personal account settings](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-02-13_15_47_11.png)
    Directions to take: 
    <br />
        * Click the sidebar on the right then Settings
        * Select `SSH and GPG keys`;
    <br />
    <br />
    Copy the contents of the contents of the id_rsa.pub file which is under the hidden .ssh directory and paste it as your personal access token
    <br />
    This is what you should be pasting in the field: 
    <br />
    ![ssh key](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-03-01_23_36_05.png)
    <br />
    From there on, I believe there will be minimal issues encountered however what if you cloned the repository using the http client
        but now cannot authenticate? Don't fret.
    
    <br />
    Head towards the repository directory using the cd command and type in the following command in your terminal: 
    <br />
    ```
    git remote set-url origin < ssh_github_repo_link >
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    The above command resets your remote-origin url to the SSH url. This means that when performing remote changes to the
        repository, it will use the SSH url.
    <br />
    You can also view the remote origin url through the below command:
    <br />
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    ## 2. The Github CLI method
    <br />
    First, `gh` has to be installed. 
    <br />
    ```
    sudo apt install gh
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    ![gh in action](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-03-01_16_01_13.png)
    <br />
    Remember to input your password since the command uses `sudo` and this requires superuser privileges. I am already running as `root`
        so I do not need to use `sudo`
    
    <br />
    For those who do not know, the github CLI is just you, logged in to your github account
        and navigating it using your terminal.
    
    <br />
    Type in the command:
    <br />
    ```
    gh auth login
    ```
    <br />
    <br />
    ![logging in using gh](/git-rid-of-it/Screenshot_2024-03-01_15_07_37.png)
    <br />
    You will be asked questions, for which you will answer according to your preference. After answering, you will be 
        given a one time code. Which you will copy then press `Enter` to open your browser and input the one-time code.

    <br />
    <b>NOTE: </b>Make sure that you are using a safe network (to prevent you from being hacked). Just use your own mobile phone hotspot.
    <br />
    After that you would have successfully logged in and freely access your projects
    <br />

    <br />
    I prefer the SSH method since it carries less risk though, but that's just me. Stay safe and git to work.
