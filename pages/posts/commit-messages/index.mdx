# Git commit messages <br /><br />
I think i love git (ThankYou Linus T)<br />

As a junior dev, you may be surprised when #real engineers write great commit messages yet yours look like garbage (yes, it is garbage)<br />

Here is a simple guide for it:<br />

It should simply involve:<br />
    1. Subject heading ( less than 50 characters)
    2. Description (mostly 72 words)
<br /> 
Naming conventions:
        - **chore**: changes that don't affect code functionality eg maintenance tasks such as updating or installing npm packages
        - **feat**: addition of a new feature to the existing codebase
        - **refactor**: improving structure of existing code without adding new functions or features
        - **fix**: when you have fixed existing code bugs or errors
        - **test**: when your commit has new or modified tests
        - **docs**: when you change documentation
        - **style**: when stylistic changes are made to the codebase without affecting functionality
        - **perf**: when you have improved performance of the codebase
<br />

Examples of messages: (your `git log` should tell a story)<br />

        - **chore: install Stripe**
        - "install stripe to enable payments"
        <br />
        - **style: fix indentition**
        - "fix indentition throughout the codebase"
        <br />
Write commit messages in present form eg `install stripe` not `installed stripe`<br />
Do this more often, especially with your personal projects (which you will never finish)<br />
Also install [gitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) VSCode extension, [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for efficiency.<br />
Gitlens:<br /><br />

<br /><br />Lazygit (it's better i promise):<br /><br />

<br /><br />Your git log should look like this: <br /><br />
