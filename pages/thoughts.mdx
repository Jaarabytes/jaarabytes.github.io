# These are some of my thoughts & reminders<br />

## 8th July 2024    

Realised that for my projects t fully succeed, i will require to dive deep back into C, learn C++. Then again, I never have written node js code before, howver i have start knowledge on it. How is this possible, how will i prove
that i can ifn fact write nodejs. 

Big problem:
- I want to build serious projects that will give me serious engineering roles
- These projects however require money (for starters a nvidia gpu)
- Money for these projects is to be gotten from the roles.

    Safe to say "Owari da" (this means "it's over" in Japanese)

### Neural networks

Three layers: input, hidden(could be numerous eg 52 layers), output. Create random weights and biases, calculate the output of each layer using the actiavtion function, compare the actual values VS the predicted values, calculate the gradient with respect to weights and bias used (backward propagation), update weights and bias , repeat

To install another Linux Distro on Sept, thinking of Manjaro.

Actively building [compose on calm](https://cocalm.netlify.app) & [ops-arena](https://ops-arena.netlify.app). Both of these projects will take me like 6 months+ to even reach half, however XP will increase.

Hopefuly in the middle of building, will be doing interviews and constantly evaluating myself. (I have to get better)

### Compose-on-calm

Installed librosa howver i need to have a python backend for it. So i added [pyscript](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript) which allows for integration of pyhton functionalities inot your webpages/website. Finally can build a full stack sveltekit app, which helps me edit music. 

The most basic thing i should add here is the Lo-fi maker, hardstyle maker. Limiting the app to only classical music is grotesque. There are existing giants that have already implemented this idea. Howver, i shoudl also eep dive into AI systems, similar to [yacine](https://yacine.ca) and his [creation](https://dingboard.com). Actively study diffusion models (i think) and make editing of the music smoother and even faster. Restructure this whole project even. 

Similar to [dingboard](https://dingboard.com), Compose-on-calm hopes to fully edit and create audio files, inside the browser. No server side code involved. Will be complex but we push through

### ops-arena

Learn devops but in a fun way. No problem except devOps is not fun and doesn't havethat much interest. However, I hope the rest of the year will massively reward me such that i can finish the two and proceed to do even more projects with my newly gained knowledge


## 30th, 1st & 2nd July 2024

Learnt neural networks, implemented [simple illustration](https://qtnx.ai/posts/how_neuron_learns/) featuring loss functions, weights, epochs and bias. <br />
Cleaning up and factorizing my [github](https://github.com/jaarabytes) (was told tech market is bad since people who hire are swe's thus they can't value interviewees correctly)<br />
Finishing up on Svelte such that I can combine it with [compose on calm], also found [this](https://x.com/nearcyan/status/1805808395963994453)<br />
Also to add `Gitty up`, where people can primarily learn git, however pitched this idea and the best feedback was once i'm done with git, i shoudl push it to more devOPs<br />
Apparently there is no proper devOps material for the world. This however aligns with me (currently leaning into more DevOps operations so i can learn and build at the same time)<br />
Best part about this is my experience is increasing, after this, i should be at least a mid-level engineer (I hope)<br />
On compose on calm add some basic monkeytype, and it will play some classical music, like piano but for typing, use tippy js for tooltips<br />
Build sth similar to monkeytype but plays random classical music when typing
**NOTE**: Neovim is just so so GOOODD!

### 2317 hrs


At 2317 hrs, mankind made a giant leap, he added google Authentication, which had bugged him for nearly 6 weeks. Mankind was elated beyond necessary. Mankind went to sleep with joy plentiful

![mankind giant leap](/thoughts/Screenshot_2024-06-29_23_16_17.png)

Jipime works , also paystack implementation is successful

For anyone wondering why streamwan lacks credentials ie email and password [login here you go](https://yacinemtb.substack.com/p/close-the-sale-dude-holy-shit)

Deployed Streamwan, now onto Gitty up (big time project, coming soon). Thinking of adding Compose-on-calm howver the two are long term and need AI/ML integration #webuild

Also installed Neovim, and using it even more. (less loading time compared to Codium and increased my typing speed to 103wpm)

You like my posts, how about a [money upvote?](/donate)

## 22nd June 2024
More challenges for me, decided to pick up ML/AI


Finished [jipime](https://jipime.vercel.app) and got three random twitter anons to use it, 115 & 94 IQ scores<br />
Next to build, (hopefully with AI), is something like Jipime but checks on people's personalities and connects them to childhood shows from CN, boomerang and Nickelodeon<br />
Stay tuned <br />


## 20th June 2024
Signed up gitlab (it's just github but more devOPs), so if i hang around here for 1.5 to 4 months, slary increases.<br />
Skillmaxxing++<br />
Also, add `::marker` to list elements, with unordered lists
## 19th June 2024
Dockerfile added and github CI/CD integrated<br/>
Safe to say, DevOps soon -><br />

## 17th June 2024
I should learn FFmpeg and add to resume. (getting more diggity with linux tools)<br />
Also, finish up devOps and take 1.5 months with python, especially pytorch.<br />
Goal is: increase XP -> demand more salary (with God as my enabler and witness)<br/>
React is good(hot garbage), but Svelte is way better #truthbetold<br />
## 15th June 2024
How cracked are you?????, here are big tools i use on a regular basis that are too helpful, big up to their respective creators:<br />
Lazygit<br/>
![lazygit is amazing!](/thoughts/Screenshot_2024-06-16_21_54_29.png)
{/* Installed extension to question all llms */}
Rewritten my whole blog page using MDX (its not that bad)
![mdx type shii](/thoughts/Screenshot_2024-06-17_09_23_06.png)
I mean look at this garbage:

## 10th June 2024<br />
Finish up with daraja Api and paystack integration into jipime<br />
Finish authentication and authroization on streamwan.<br />
I have to finish up learning Docker, github CI/CD and start using lazydocker even more. From here i can add devops into my resume.<br />
Lazygit is great, i officially uninstalled gitlens from both VSCodium and VsCode<br />
Thinking of learning neovim (I just use when in a hurry) however it looks great<br />
To be a 10x engineer i also installed ripgrep, exa and bat/ batcat (I'm getting more cracked by the day)<br />
I should also try kubernetes<br /><br /><br />

My resume is my github, it should include:<br />
    - 3 python projects<br />
        - One automation script
        - One involving neural networks
        - Tom cruise go brrr<br/>
    - 1 java project<br />
        - Slapsgiving <br />
    - Dockerfiles and github CI/Cd automation in place<br />
    - NextJs (this is my selling point)<br />
        - Jipime (almost done)
        - Streamwan (fix auth issues)
        - Redo astral Ecorp (really sell it, possibly do it with Svelte)<br />
    - More blockchain...(but with AI/ML)<br />
{/* Insert cracked images of lazygit, lazydocker, zsh config, bat, ripgrep and exa */}
