## These are some of my thoughts & reminders<br />

# 15th June 2024<br />
Finish up with daraja Api and paystack integration into jipime<br />
Finish authentication and authroization on streamwan.<br />
I have to finish up learning Docker, github CI/CD and start using lazydocker even more. From here i can add devops into my resume.<br />
Lazygit is great, i officially uninstalled gitlens from both VSCodium and VsCode<br />
Thinking of learning neovim (I just use when in a hurry) however it looks great<br />
To be a 10x engineer i also installed ripgrep, exa and bat/ batcat (I'm getting more cracked by the day)<br />
I should also try kubernetes<br />
