# These are some of my thoughts & reminders<br />

## 19th June 2024

I should learn FFmpeg and add to resume. (getting more diggity with linux tools)<br />
Also, finish up devOps and take 1.5 months with python, especially pytorch.<br />
Goal is: increase XP -> demand more salary (with God as my enabler and witness)<br/>
React is good(hot garbage), but Svelte is way better #truthbetold<br />

How cracked are you?????, here are big tools i use on a regular basis that are too helpful, big up to their respective creators:<br />
Lazygit<br/>

## 10th June 2024<br />
Finish up with daraja Api and paystack integration into jipime<br />
Finish authentication and authroization on streamwan.<br />
I have to finish up learning Docker, github CI/CD and start using lazydocker even more. From here i can add devops into my resume.<br />
Lazygit is great, i officially uninstalled gitlens from both VSCodium and VsCode<br />
Thinking of learning neovim (I just use when in a hurry) however it looks great<br />
To be a 10x engineer i also installed ripgrep, exa and bat/ batcat (I'm getting more cracked by the day)<br />
I should also try kubernetes<br /><br /><br />

My resume is my github, it should include:<br />
    - 3 python projects<br />
        - One automation script
        - One involving neural networks
        - Tom cruise go brrr<br/>
    - 1 java project<br />
        - Slapsgiving <br />
    - Dockerfiles and github CI/Cd automation in place<br />
    - NextJs (this is my selling point)<br />
        - Jipime (almost done)
        - Streamwan (fix auth issues)
        - Redo astral Ecorp (really sell it, possibly do it with Svelte)<br />
    - More blockchain...(but with AI/ML)<br />
