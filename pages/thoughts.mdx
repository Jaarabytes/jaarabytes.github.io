## These are some of my thoughts & reminders<br />

# 15th June 2024<br />
Finish up with daraja Api and paystack integration into jipime<br />
Finish authentication and authroization on streamwan.<br />
I have to finish up learning Docker, github CI/CD and start using lazydocker even more. From here i can add devops into my resume.<br />
Lazygit is great, i officially uninstalled gitlens from both VSCodium and VsCode<br />
Thinking of learning neovim (I just use when in a hurry) however it looks great<br />
To be a 10x engineer i also installed ripgrep, exa and bat/ batcat (I'm getting more cracked by the day)<br />
I should also try kubernetes<br /><br /><br />

My resume is my github, it should include:<br />
    3 python projects<br />
        - One automation script
        - One involving neural networks
        - Tom cruise go brrr<br/>
    1 java project<br />
        - Slapsgiving <br />
    Dockerfiles and github CI/Cd automation in place<br />
    NextJs (this is my selling point)<br />
        - Jipime (almost done)
        - Streamwan
        - Redo astral Ecorp<br />
    More blockchain...(but with AI/ML)<br />
