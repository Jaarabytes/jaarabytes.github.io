### 2317 hrs


At 2317 hrs, mankind made a giant leap, he added google Authentication, which had bugged him for nearly 6 weeks. Mankind was elated beyond necessary. Mankind went to sleep with joy plentiful

Jipime works , also paystack implementation is successful

For anyone wondering why streamwan lacks credentials ie email and password [login here you go](https://yacinemtb.substack.com/p/close-the-sale-dude-holy-shit)

Deployed Streamwan, now onto Gitty up (big time project, coming soon). Thinking of adding Compose-on-calm howver the two are long term and need AI/ML integration #webuild

Also installed Neovim, and using it even more. (less loading time compared to Codium and increased my typing speed to 103wpm)

More challenges for me, decided to pick up ML/AI


Finished [jipime](https://jipime.vercel.app) and got three random twitter anons to use it, 115 & 94 IQ scores<br />
Next to build, (hopefully with AI), is something like Jipime but checks on people's personalities and connects them to childhood shows from CN, boomerang and Nickelodeon<br />
Stay tuned <br />

Signed up gitlab (it's just github but more devOPs), so if i hang around here for 1.5 to 4 months, slary increases.<br />
Skillmaxxing++<br />
Also, add `::marker` to list elements, with unordered lists
## 19th June 2024
Dockerfile added and github CI/CD integrated<br/>
Safe to say, DevOps soon -><br />

I should learn FFmpeg and add to resume. (getting more diggity with linux tools)<br />
Also, finish up devOps and take 1.5 months with python, especially pytorch.<br />
Goal is: increase XP -> demand more salary (with God as my enabler and witness)<br/>
React is good(hot garbage), but Svelte is way better #truthbetold<br />

How cracked are you?????, here are big tools i use on a regular basis that are too helpful, big up to their respective creators:<br />
Lazygit<br/>

Finish up with daraja Api and paystack integration into jipime<br />
Finish authentication and authroization on streamwan.<br />
I have to finish up learning Docker, github CI/CD and start using lazydocker even more. From here i can add devops into my resume.<br />
Lazygit is great, i officially uninstalled gitlens from both VSCodium and VsCode<br />
Thinking of learning neovim (I just use when in a hurry) however it looks great<br />
To be a 10x engineer i also installed ripgrep, exa and bat/ batcat (I'm getting more cracked by the day)<br />
I should also try kubernetes<br /><br /><br />

My resume is my github, it should include:<br />
    - 3 python projects<br />
        - One automation script
        - One involving neural networks
        - Tom cruise go brrr<br/>
    - 1 java project<br />
        - Slapsgiving <br />
    - Dockerfiles and github CI/Cd automation in place<br />
    - NextJs (this is my selling point)<br />
        - Jipime (almost done)
        - Streamwan (fix auth issues)
        - Redo astral Ecorp (really sell it, possibly do it with Svelte)<br />
    - More blockchain...(but with AI/ML)<br />
